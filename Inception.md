  Interview 1: 
    Interviewee: Potential Customer 
    Interviewer: Amber Quinn 
    Date: 6/10/2025 
    Customer Segment: Cooks 
    Key Insights: The interviewee experiences significant food waste, particularly with produce items that spoil before consumption. They "frequently have to throw away produce items" and "it [Apple Reminders] is really not great with food items" as they find it inadequate for tracking perishable items since it lacks food-specific functionality. They expressed strong interest in a solution that could provide product-specific guidance and faster usability than their current workaround. The interviewee revealed uncertainty about willingness to pay for such a solution, indicating price sensitivity may be a consideration for this customer segment. This interview gave us insight into the unexpectedness of produce expiration dates, which could be incorporated into our application. 
    Assessment: Nice to have - While the interviewee expressed definite interest in using the solution and clearly experiences the problem regularly, their uncertainty about purchasing the application suggests this represents potential rather than urgent need, placing them in the "nice to have" category rather than "must have." 

  Interview 2: 
    Interviewee: Potential Developer 
    Interviewer: Amber Quinn 
    Date 6/12/2025 
    Customer Segment: Technical Professionals 
    Key Insights: The interviewee identified significant usability concerns with the current product concept, specifically highlighting that manually tracking every food item would create user fatigue and adoption barriers. They demonstrated engagement with the problem space by proposing alternative solutions to the existing “exhaustive process” including weekly summary reports and automated sensor systems, suggesting they see value in addressing food waste but believe the current approach is flawed. Their focus on user-friendliness of modifications indicates they view the core problem as valid, but the proposed solution isn’t necessarily “user-friendly” requiring a fundamentally different implementation approach.
    Assessment: Don't care - While the interviewee acknowledged the problem exists, they showed little interest in the proposed solution format and expressed significant reservations about its viability, indicating they don't see meaningful value in the current product concept despite their willingness to suggest alternatives. 

Interview 3:  
    Interviewee: Working Mother 
    Interviewer: Chip Haskins 
    Date: 6/15/2025 
    Customer Segment: Family 
    Key Insights: The product seems desirable among working parents who see food spoil 	without anyone touching it. Interviewee showed appreciation for recipe suggestions as 	they frequently find themselves with a surplus of produce or leftovers with no ideas for 	how to use them. Suggested the ability to see recipe suggestions for inventory at any 	time, as well as integration with smart home appliances to automatically add items to the 	registry. Also suggested a feature that shows how to store items when entering them in, 	e.g. a picture of a head of lettuce in the refrigerator.
    Assessment: Must have – Interviewee said they would “even pay $1.99” for such a 	product on the App Store. Was enthusiastic throughout the interview, expressing a 	genuine need for the product and provided several suggestions for desired features.
