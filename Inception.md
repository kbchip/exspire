3. Interviews Summary (15 points) (NEED 8) 

  Interview 1: 
    Interviewee: Potential Customer 
    Interviewer: Amber Quinn 
    Date: 6/10/2025 
    Customer Segment: Cooks 
    Key Insights: The interviewee experiences significant food waste, particularly with produce items that spoil before consumption. They "frequently have to throw away produce items" and "it [Apple Reminders] is really not great with food items" as they find it inadequate for tracking perishable items since it lacks food-specific functionality. They expressed strong interest in a solution that could provide product-specific guidance and faster usability than their current workaround. The interviewee revealed uncertainty about willingness to pay for such a solution, indicating price sensitivity may be a consideration for this customer segment. This interview gave us insight into the unexpectedness of produce expiration dates, which could be incorporated into our application. 
    Assessment: Nice to have - While the interviewee expressed definite interest in using the solution and clearly experiences the problem regularly, their uncertainty about purchasing the application suggests this represents potential rather than urgent need, placing them in the "nice to have" category rather than "must have." 

  Interview 2: 
    Interviewee: Potential Developer 
    Interviewer: Amber Quinn 
    Date 6/12/2025 
    Customer Segment: Technical Professionals 
    Key Insights: The interviewee identified significant usability concerns with the current product concept, specifically highlighting that manually tracking every food item would create user fatigue and adoption barriers. They demonstrated engagement with the problem space by proposing alternative solutions to the existing “exhaustive process” including weekly summary reports and automated sensor systems, suggesting they see value in addressing food waste but believe the current approach is flawed. Their focus on user-friendliness of modifications indicates they view the core problem as valid, but the proposed solution isn’t necessarily “user-friendly” requiring a fundamentally different implementation approach.
    Assessment: Don't care - While the interviewee acknowledged the problem exists, they showed little interest in the proposed solution format and expressed significant reservations about its viability, indicating they don't see meaningful value in the current product concept despite their willingness to suggest alternatives. 

Interview 3:  
    Interviewee: Working Mother 
    Interviewer: Chip Haskins 
    Date: 6/15/2025 
    Customer Segment: Family 
    Key Insights: The product seems desirable among working parents who see food spoil 	without anyone touching it. Interviewee showed appreciation for recipe suggestions as 	they frequently find themselves with a surplus of produce or leftovers with no ideas for 	how to use them. Suggested the ability to see recipe suggestions for inventory at any 	time, as well as integration with smart home appliances to automatically add items to the 	registry. Also suggested a feature that shows how to store items when entering them in, 	e.g. a picture of a head of lettuce in the refrigerator.
    Assessment: Must have – Interviewee said they would “even pay $1.99” for such a 	product on the App Store. Was enthusiastic throughout the interview, expressing a 	genuine need for the product and provided several suggestions for desired features. 
	 
Interview 4: 
	Interviewee: College Student (living in shared apartment) 
 	Interviewer: Kalyana Pabbisetty 
  	Date: 6/13/2025 
   	Customer segment: Busy college students handling multiple responsibilities like academics, part-time jobs and shared living having a limited budget on groceries. 
    	Key insights: The interviewee shared a lot of what food items what they get unnoticed and then winds up in the bin. With classes and a part-time job, they struggle to keep track of what is in the fridge. It is mentioned that this issue is especially frustrating when it comes to leftovers. The student expressed strong concern about wasting food, because of the limited student budget. While he mentioned the plan of teaming up with roommates to do better, he felt that an app like this could be helpful provided that it is easy to use and reasonably priced. 
     Representative quotes: 
     “Just yesterday, I threw out handful of spinach and a milk can and this happens very often” 
     “Wanna have conversation with my roommate, planning to have it tomorrow once he arrives from his job” 
     Assessment: Nice to have, considering various factors like ease of use and pricing. 

Nice to have, considering various factors like ease of use and pricing. 

Interview 5: 
	Interviewee: Elderly person living alone 
 	Interviewer: Kalyana Pabbisetty 
  	Date: 6/14/2025 
   Customer Segment: Seniors living alone with less tech knowledge 
   Key insights: The interviewee has a very organized approach to grocery shopping, purchasing only a few essential items with limited quantities with long shelf lives. She makes sure to keep them visible, and easily accessible such that nothing goes unnoticed. When asked about using an app to track expiration dates, she expressed skepticism. She felt that if tracking was ever needed, she would prefer noting things down rather than relying on a phone app, especially one that might require payment or additional effort. She told me that, in her view, an app like this might be the one that goes unnoticed, not food. 
   Representative Quotes: 
   “I make sure to only buy what I need for a week or so, depending on how often I use each item, and I keep everything right on my table or in the fridge where I can see it.” 
   “If I really had to track something, I’d stick a note on my fridge. I don’t want an app for that” 
   “Honestly I think the app might get ignored not the food” 
   Assessment: Don’t care
