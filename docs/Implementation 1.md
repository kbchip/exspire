# 1. Introduction

Xspire is a food tracking application for people who want to get the most out of their ingredients. Users can keep tabs on when food was bought, where it is stored, and when it expires. Xspire also provides recipe suggestions for food that's about to go bad, as well as recipes that only include ingredients the user has on hand.

**Value Proposition:** Xspire helps users reduce food waste, save money, and positively impact the environment by tracking food inventory and sending timely alerts to avoid spoilage.

**Main Features:**
- Food inventory
- Expiration date tracking
- Expiration alerts
- Smart recipe suggestions based on soon-to-expire items
- Waste tracking and analytics
- Shopping list generation
- Multi-user household support
